      <p class="text-muted">
        Founded in the memory of Late Shri Narsing Eknath Nadiwade (NEN), the foundation is deeply rooted in a lived journey of resilience and transformation.
        Shri NEN came from a rural, below-poverty background and was a first-generation learner who experienced firsthand the barriers of limited resources,
        lack of guidance, and social constraints.
      </p>

      <p class="text-muted">
        Despite these challenges, education became the turning point of his life. Through perseverance, self-discipline, and continuous learning,
        he transformed hardship into strength—eventually establishing himself and dedicating his journey to uplifting others from similar backgrounds.
      </p>

      <p class="text-muted">
        Inspired by this lived experience, <strong>Yashodeep</strong> works to identify, support, and nurture economically disadvantaged yet talented students,
        especially from rural areas. By providing educational support, skill development, mentoring, and exposure, the organization aims to break the cycle
        of poverty and create confident, self-reliant individuals.
      </p>

      <p class="text-muted mb-0">
        Our mission is not just to educate, but to build role models within rural communities—proving that with the right support,
        first-generation learners can rise, lead, and inspire others to dream bigger.
